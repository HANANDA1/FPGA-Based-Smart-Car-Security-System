## Introduction

Car theft is a significant concern for vehicle owners. Traditional security systems often fall short in providing real-time monitoring and quick response. Our FPGA-based solution aims to bridge this gap. By leveraging the power of FPGA technology, we can implement a robust system that not only detects unauthorized access but also takes immediate action to secure the vehicle.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors vehicle status and surroundings.
- **Unauthorized Access Detection**: Detects any attempts to breach the vehicle's security.
- **Immediate Response**: Activates alarms or locks to deter theft.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple controls for easy operation.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can adjust sensitivity and response settings according to their needs.

## Hardware Requirements

To build and run the FPGA-Based Smart Car Security System, you will need the following hardware components:

- FPGA Development Board (e.g., Xilinx, Altera)
- Sensors (e.g., motion sensors, door sensors)
- Alarm System
- Power Supply
- Connecting Wires
- Breadboard (optional for prototyping)

## Software Requirements

The following software tools are necessary for programming and simulating the FPGA:

- **FPGA Development Software**: Xilinx Vivado or Intel Quartus
- **SystemVerilog or Verilog**: For hardware description and design
- **Simulation Tools**: ModelSim or any compatible simulator

## Installation

1. **Download the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HANANDA1/FPGA-Based-Smart-Car-Security-System.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Software**: Ensure that you have the necessary FPGA development software installed.

3. **Open the Project**: Launch your FPGA development software and open the project files located in the cloned repository.

4. **Configure the FPGA Board**: Connect your FPGA board to your computer and configure it according to the software instructions.

5. **Compile the Code**: Use the development software to compile the code. This process converts your design into a format that the FPGA can understand.

6. **Upload to FPGA**: Once compiled, upload the design to the FPGA board.

## Usage

After successfully uploading the design to the FPGA, you can start using the Smart Car Security System. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Power On**: Turn on the vehicle and the security system.
2. **Set Sensitivity**: Use the user interface to adjust the sensitivity of the sensors.
3. **Test the System**: Simulate unauthorized access to test the system's response.
4. **Monitor Status**: Keep an eye on the real-time monitoring display for alerts.
